# Randomize
## Description
Randomize is an application dedicated to generating random music recommendations for users to expand their musical horizons.
With the overwhelming amount of music released, it may be difficult to determine which songs are worth listening to. 
Randomize generates 10 songs based on the Spotify's Global and US Top 50 Charts and our user-added songs.
Our app provides a quick tool to generate music suggestions without unnecessary data and features.
